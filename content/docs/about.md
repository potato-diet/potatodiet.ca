# About

## Overview
I'm an amateur, hoping to one day be a professional, software developer.

I never graduated, or even really attended, high school, but somehow ended up in my current status as a struggling Computer Science student at the University of Toronto after a brief one year stint as a Computer Engineering student at Algonquin College.
