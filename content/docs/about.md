# About

## Overview
I'm an amateur, hoping to one day be a professional, software developer.

I never graduated, or even really attended, high school, but somehow ended up in my current status as a struggling Computer Science student at the University of Toronto after a brief one year stint as a Computer Engineering student at Algonquin College.

## What I Use
### Desktop
Since sometime around 2014 I've been using Linux as my main operating system. I started off with Ubuntu, and eventually after trialing all the popular distributions, landed on ArchLinux, mostly due to the amazing Arch User Repository. My setup has been pretty stable for the past few years. I use Sway as my window manager, i3 is probably still for the most part better to use since I still run into issues with Steam games on Sway, but it's acceptable. Otherwise, I have to say that tiling window managers are the absolute best for productivity. I truly can not imagine how computer-dependent workers manage with the normal GUI workflow.

I use Firefox along with the extensions uBlock Origin, Bitwarden, and ViolentMonkey. The choice of browser doesn't really matter, as effectively all the major mainstream browsers are essentially the same.

I use just a single 2560x1440 144Hz 27" monitor as I get all the benefits of a multi-monitor setup I need, without the downsides of increased deskspace usage and head movement.
