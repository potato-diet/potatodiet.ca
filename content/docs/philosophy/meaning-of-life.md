# Richard Taylor's The Meaning of Life

## Preamble
The following is an essay I wrote for PHL113 at UofT during the summer of 2020.

## Content
In this paper I will discuss Richard Taylor’s 1970 work, The Meaning of Life, where he argues that life does have meaning and it’s subjective.

I will preface my writing by first saying that my own thoughts do tend towards Taylor’s, in that I do agree the meaning of life is subjective. However, I don’t accept that he proved so, or did well enough to convince opponents. I also very much so enjoyed his style of writing and accepted the majority of his buildup arguments. I thought by the end that I would accept his overarching argument, but instead I found little connection between the arguments I agreed with and the end goal of showing life has meaning.

Now I’ll start by giving an overview of Taylor’s arguments in what I hope to be a generous manner. Taylor spends the majority of his writing by first explaining the idea of what an objectively meaningless life would be. He begins this by giving the example of the Greek myth of Sisyphus, a figure which had to endure rolling a stone continually up a hill for it to only roll back down for entirety. This example is to show what is an objectively meaningless life. Sisyphus’ actions do not have any impact on the world, and is meant as a punishment, something I would think close to all would see as meaningless. [1] Taylor then imagines that Sisyphus’ mind was magically changed to then view his task as deeply rewarding, and says that now Sisyphus would have a meaningful life as his desires now match up with his actions, in essence he is now no longer forced to do an action which he hates but is instead forced to do an action he loves. I find this mind frame based argument incorrect, which I’ll get into after. [2]

Next, Taylor enters into reality by giving the example of worms living on the the walls of a cave, there only purpose being to lie in wait for insects to come within range to be eaten, doing this in perpetuity until reaching old age in which they lay eggs and then promptly die, to be finally then cannibalized by other worms in waiting. [3] Later on he gives a related example of migratory birds, whose only purpose in life is to migrate great distance to give birth and then return back to their home, all other moments of their life only exist to ensure this task is done. [4] Both examples are again good examples of what seem to be meaningless lives, which as aside, Taylor will at the end try to show as actually meaningful lives.

With these examples, and other similar ones Taylor mentioned which I left out for brevity, he explores us to connect them to our own lives, and in fact all life. That just like Sisyphus or a migratory bird, we perform practically endless cycles with seemingly no end goal. That we can think of each of Sisyphus’ uphill rolls as one individual life, and when we die the ball rolls back down only for our children to then roll the rock back up. And that even if eventually this enduring toil results in the creation of a beautiful temple upon the hill, that like everything, eventually the temple will decay to dust without repetitive maintenance. Taylor here shows signs of his end argument, where he tries to show that the lack of an end is required for meaning. [4]

Taylor again mentions the idea of what if Sisyphus’ mind frame was changed so that instead his endless task was no longer a prison sentence, but instead his entire desire. This would surely be a far better life from the point of view of Sisyphus, and in Taylor’s view also a subjectively more meaningful life. So even though Sisyphus’ life did not change, his thoughts on life changed which therefore gave meaning to his life. [5] [6]

Sisyphus is used again to explore a thought experiment on the idea of infinite boredom. What if Sisyphus was building a temple, and such a temple was eventually completed. Now what is he to do? Now is he to simply sit there and look at his temple? In this world Sisyphus’ life does have meaning, as it was to build a temple which has now been done, but the completion of which has resulted in a version of hell for Sisyphus in the manner of infinite boredom. Before we had an eternal hell of pointless existence, and now we have created an eternal hell in its absence. [6]

Taylor uses these two versions of a hell to solidify his argument that the meaning of life doesn’t require any sort of meaningful end goal to be eventually completed and in fact requires the lack of any such end state, but instead meaning comes from the intersection of will and the act of available seemingly repetitive tasks. [7]

I find Taylor’s explanations of meaningless lives fairly convincing, though not totally so, which I think breaks down his conclusion. I will accept that a life of repetitive actions towards no end, disconnected from the will of one living such life is meaningless. However, I don’t necessarily agree that a life where the actions and will are working in tandem towards an end goal is meaningless due to eventual boredom. Why does it have to be that our meaning is to keep our will satisfied, or to modify our will to suit our environment? It may seem obvious at first glance that if one’s will isn’t satisfied then life will be agony, but I don’t think necessarily you can conclude that the meaning of life is to avoid that. If I had the option change my will so any action would become my deepest desire, would that have to then be a meaningful life as literally any action I performed would satisfy my will? Or with equal effect, would changing my will to be infinite boredom and do nothing be then meaningful?

Also another perhaps stronger point is the manner of which free will is involved. As of now the arguments against free will existing are strong enough to at least be forced to consider. If free will doesn’t exist, then how can the meaning of life be “...to be living, in the manner that it is your nature to be living”? [7] We have no choice but to live how we live if free will doesn’t exist. We simply must live as is in our nature to be living, for there’s no other alternative. If I kidnap someone and force them to build me a castle, but use a magic potion to have them desire to do so, do they really live a meaningful life? If free will doesn’t exist, this isn’t so different from us living our lives in the manner that is our nature to be living.
