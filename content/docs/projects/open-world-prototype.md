title: Open World Prototype
---

## Description
Around 2015, before starting College when I was completing my GED, me and a friend began developing a game with Unity. It was meant to be an open world game where you can go around destroying objects, collecting resources, and building tools and structures. Before discontinuing development, we implemented pathfinding where a tic-tac-like object follows you around, an inventory system where you can pick up a pickaxe / regular axe and select between the two with your number keys, and the ability to chop down trees by clicking on their base with the axe in your hand.
