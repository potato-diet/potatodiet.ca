title: Image Board
---

## Description
Throughout mid-2014, I developed a danbooru-style website which lets users share and images. Other users can then discover interesting and relevant images by searching with community generated tags. There's also support for a per-image commenting system along with admin roles which lets admins delete any comment or image. The website was originally built with Rails 4, and then in 2020, updated to Rails 6. I used Vagrant to create a consistent development environment, but now Vagrant is basically obsolete and replaced with Docker.

## Access
The source code can be viewed on [GitHub](https://github.com/potato-diet/image_board), and there is a [demo](https://ib.potatodiet.ca) available.
