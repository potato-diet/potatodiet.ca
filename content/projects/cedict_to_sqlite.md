---

[CEDICT to SQLite](https://github.com/potato-diet/cedict_to_sqlite) is a python script which downloads [CC-CEDICT](https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?page=cedict), a popular Chinese to English translation database, and converts it into an SQLite database. The script supports displaying pinyin as both character accents (รก) and number identifiers (a1).
