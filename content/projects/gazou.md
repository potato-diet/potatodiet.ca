## Description
I've always loved the joyful experience of developing with Ruby but the poor performance and lack
of static typing is a major sore spot, luckily Crystal exists. Crystal is basically a statically 
typed compiled Ruby, so it's obviously something I'd want to use.

In June 2020, I had the brilliantly unique idea of coppying the basics of
[Catbox](https://catbox.moe/). Quickly, I had a MVP developed which let users upload images, 
returning a deduplicated URL pointing towards their image to send to others.

## Access
The source code can be viewed on [GitHub](https://github.com/potato-diet/gazou), and a
[demo](https://gazou.potatodiet.ca) is available.
