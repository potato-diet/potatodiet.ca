title: UofT Tools
---

[UofT Tools](https://github.com/potato-diet/uoft-tools) is a collection of scripts which I've developed since beginning undergraduate studies to help with various tasks at UofT. Once I graduate, they'll propably go unmaintained and become of little use.

Currently there's two tools:
* UofT Prof Ratings - A webextension which adds ratemyprof.com info to the course selection websites.
* Course Finder - A python script which lets you fill in which courses you've taken and then gives you a list of courses you're able to enroll in.
