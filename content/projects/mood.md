## Description
On 18 March 2021, I developed a quick little website which takes your 50 most recently played Spotify songs and compares them to the [Top 50 - Global](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZEVXbMDoHDwVN2tF) playlist, showing you how your listening habits compare to the norm for energy, happiness, and danceability. The website is very simple with a basic UI, and was just built to help me understand a few things about React. The demo is also hosted with Cloudflare Pages which is a pretty simple and seamless process which I'd recommend using.

## Access
The source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/potato-diet/mood), and a [demo](https://mood.potatodiet.ca) is available.
